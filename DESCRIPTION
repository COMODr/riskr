Title: Functions to facilitate the credit scoring tasks
Description: The riskr package facilitate credit scoring tasks 
  such as measure the scores/models performance
  and the scoring modelling process: measure in a simple way
  the performance of models via wrappers/shortcuts from
  ROCR functions, visualize relationships between variables.
  Also there are functions to compute usual values
  in the credit scoring PSI, WOE, IV, KS, AUCROC, among others.
  And finally, make easier the modelling and validation process.
